INTRODUCTION                            *markdown-composer*

While editing markdown, this plugin will open a browser containing a preview
of the HTML generated by your markdown. The preview is edited in real time as
you edit the buffer in Vim.

OPTIONS                                 *markdown-composer-options*

g:markdown_composer_browser             *g:markdown_composer_browser*
            Specifies a specific browser for the plugin to use. If not set,
            then the plugin will try to determine the default browser.

g:markdown_composer_open_browser        *g:markdown_composer_open_browser*
            If set to 0, the plugin will not attempt to open the user's
            browser, instead requiring them to open it manually.

            Default: 1

g:markdown_composer_syntax_theme        *g:markdown_composer_syntax_theme*
            The theme that the preview should use for syntax highlighting. All
            themes from highlight.js are supported. A demo can be found at
            https://highlightjs.org/static/demo/.

            The variable should be the name of the theme's stylesheet (without
            .css). The stylesheets may be found at
